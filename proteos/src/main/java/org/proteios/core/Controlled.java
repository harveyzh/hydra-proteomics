/**
	This is the base tagging interface for items that needs special 
	attention by the {@link DbControl} object when {@link DbControl#commit()}
	is called. If an item implements this interface it is automatically
	placed in the internal commit queue of the <code>DbControl</code> object.
	Depending on which subinterfaces that are implemented (for example
	{@link Validatable} or {@link Transactional}) the <code>DbControl</code>
	takes certain actions.
