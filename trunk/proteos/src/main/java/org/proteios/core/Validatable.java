	This interface is a tagging interface for items that needs case 2
	validation. See <a 
	href="../../../../../../development/overview/core/datavalidation,html">Core API overview - 
	Data validation</a> and <a 
	href="../../../../../../development/coding/item/index.html#validation">Coding rules and 
	guidelines for item classes</a>
	<p>
	By implementing this interface an item tells the <code>DbControl</code>
	to call the {@link BasicItem#validate()} whenever commit is called.
