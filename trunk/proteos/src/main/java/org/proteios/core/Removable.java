/**
	A <code>Removable</code> item is an item that can be flagged
	as removed. This doesn't generally remove the information about the
	item from the database, but can be used by client applications
	to hide items that the user is not interested in.
	<p>
	For example, all methods generating lists of items, will by default
	not include those that are flagged as removed.
	<p>
	At regular intervals, a cleanup application is checking the database for 
	items that are flagged to be removed and deletes them permanently.
	<p>
