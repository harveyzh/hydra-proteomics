= Introduction =

Hydra is designed to function as a pluggable replacement for the X!Tandem search engine with added capabilities described in other documents. It is designed to run from the command line using a single argument, an XML file containing parameters required for the search. The deployments (see [http://code.google.com/p/hydra-proteomics/downloads/list downloads]) include a batch file (windows) or shell script
